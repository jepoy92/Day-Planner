# Day-Planner

# Description

Welcome! Project Day-Planner was designed to help users keep track of their daily tasks. 
Their tasks are logged using local storage which saves their information so that they are able to
review their tasks through out the day.

## Moment.js

This app uses Moment.js for the following features.

1. Updates the date and time every second
2. Visually updates the planner to show what hours have past, what is the current hour, and what hours are left in the day

## Jquery

This app uses jquery for the following features.

1. Sends user input to local storage so that the information persists and displays in the timeblocks
2. Used a for loop to generate all html elements on the page
3. Puts a condition on each timeblock to update their current time status depending on the value in
Moment.js (past, present, future)
